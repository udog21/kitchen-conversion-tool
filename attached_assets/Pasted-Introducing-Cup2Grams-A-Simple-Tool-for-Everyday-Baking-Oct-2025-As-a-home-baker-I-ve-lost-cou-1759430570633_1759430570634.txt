Introducing Cup2Grams: A Simple Tool for Everyday Baking
Oct 2025

As a home baker, I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve pulled out my phone mid-recipe to check a measurement conversion. One recipe might call for a cup of flour, another for 120 grams, and a third might list everything in tablespoons. While cups and spoons are common in recipes, others rely entirely on weight. Switching back and forth quickly becomes frustrating, especially when accuracy is the difference between a perfect sponge and a dense disappointment.

Volume-to-weight conversions have always been the trickiest. A “cup” isn’t a universal standard — U.S., U.K., and Australian cups all measure slightly differently, and ingredients themselves vary. A cup of flour doesn’t weigh the same as a cup of sugar, and that doesn’t even touch liquids, syrups, or sticky ingredients. I wanted a fast, reliable way to translate between systems without flipping through books, scrolling endless Google results, or relying on conversion charts that often contradict each other.

That’s why I built this app. It’s a simple, lightweight tool designed to solve one very specific problem: giving bakers and cooks a quick way to convert common kitchen measurements. Whether you’re moving from liters to cups, grams to ounces, or just trying to figure out what a tablespoon of butter weighs, you’ll be able to find an answer in seconds. My goal was to make it clean, mobile-friendly, and distraction-free so you can use it right at the counter without juggling tabs.

Over time, I’ll continue expanding the app to include more ingredients, regional standards, and even tips for making substitutions in a pinch. Baking is already enough of a science experiment — measurement shouldn’t be the stumbling block that holds you back.

I hope you find this tool as useful in your kitchen as I have in mine. If you have suggestions, notice a missing conversion, or want to share how you’re using it, I’d love to hear from you. After all, the best recipes are shared, tested, and improved together.

Happy baking, and may your next loaf, cake, or cookie turn out just the way you imagined!
